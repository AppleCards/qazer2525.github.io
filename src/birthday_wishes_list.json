And now it does look like you're managing things a lot better :D YA I'm super encouraged when you shared about how you mentioned you planned to stay at home to complete assignments during the RVVL night period. But then you still chose to come, so that you won't miss out on the things that God is doing. I still remember you joined my small group once after radcon and shared about God speaking to you about the power of words. How is that going!! I pray that even as you get older, that God may show you how dear you are to His heart and that you may trade the way you see yourself for how He sees you. Have a great one!"

And even now you expect so much more because you know God has so much more in store for you! what a powerful expectation to have! no longer do you settle for what the world can give you but you know truly God has the best in store for you, keep pursuing that!

I am very glad that I got to see your different phases of life and now you are in uni ! Even tho you are a true introvert and is always quiet, but you are always listening and involved even tho you may not speak up and that is something I appreciate about you ! ((: You have been faithful throughout these years and even tho people come and go, I am glad that you are one of them that stayed !! Your quiet perseverance is something that I am always encouraged and inspired by. Sometimes it is so easy to be quick to complain and be depressed/crushed about circumstances or trials, but I admire your attitude of just accepting and pushing on despite not having the most favourable situation. Your seemingly unwavering attitude and determination to work something out is something that I should learn 🥹 Even tho we are multiplying soon and will not be in the same lifegroup, but I hope that we will still say hi to each other ok hahahaha. Better not ignore me when u see me ok :”) Have a very blessed birthday and I hope you enjoy ur special day with your loved ones ! 🎂🎂☺️☺️ P.S. you and Tee Hong’s relationship is adorable 🥰"
