And now it does look like you're managing things a lot better :D YA I'm super encouraged when you shared about how you mentioned you planned to stay at home to complete assignments during the RVVL night period. But then you still chose to come, so that you won't miss out on the things that God is doing. I still remember you joined my small group once after radcon and shared about God speaking to you about the power of words. How is that going!! I pray that even as you get older, that God may show you how dear you are to His heart and that you may trade the way you see yourself for how He sees you. Have a great one!"
